**pudu** is a Python package that helps interpret and explore the results of machine learning algorithms 
with spectroscopic data. It does this by quantifying the change in the prediction according to the change 
in the features. This library works with classification and regression problems with both 1-d and 2-d problems. 

Features
--------

The following is a list of the main procedures that **pudu** package enables.

The following is a list of the main features that **pudu** package enables.

- Importance: measures the change in prediction according to perturbations in the features.
- Speed: calculates how fast a prediction changes according to different perturbation levels.
- Synergy: tests the synergy between features and the change in classification probability.
- Re-activations: Evaluates how activations maps from CNNs change according to perturbations in the data.
- Easy plotting with ample personalization options for all the cases above.
